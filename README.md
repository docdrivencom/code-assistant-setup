# DocDriven Code Assistant Setup

## What's This About?
Stumbled into this corner of the internet by accident? Welcome! This repository is all about setting up the **DocDriven Code Assistant**. If you’re not sure what that means, head over to [docdriven.com](https://docdriven.com) to get the lowdown.

## The Configuration File
First things first, create a `docdriven.config.json` file in the root of your repository. This is the magic key that lets the **DocDriven Code Assistant** understand your setup.


## Templates
The configuration file points to file templates that the **DocDriven Code Assistant** uses as its blueprint. To help you get started, we’ve thrown in some [examples](examples) for:

- dotnet
- laravel
- rails

Remember, these configurations are just basic examples. To get the best out of the **DocDriven Code Assistant**, customize them based on your framework, namespace, coding style, libraries, and anything else you use.
